# NIRSpec_GTO_sims_STScI_reduction

The notebook in this repository describes the efforts of the NIRSpec GTO and STScI 
teams to take simulations produced at part of the NIRSpec GTO effort, and make them 
reducible in the STScI pipeline.

Please see [here](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/jwst-nirspec-simulations/deep-fields) 
for details of the data this notebook relates to and how to download it.  You can
use the issues here for any problems with reduction or data access.
